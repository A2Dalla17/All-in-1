/**
 * ACT — London fare estimation
 *
 * ── Why this exists ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Distance, duration and price were all fetched from the Go backend:
 * /maps/route and /pricing/bulk-estimate. That backend is deployed nowhere.
 * Every one of those requests resolved to the SPA's own index.html, failed on
 * a JSON parse, and left the booking screen with no miles, no minutes and no
 * price — permanently, and with nothing on screen to explain it.
 *
 * A minicab app that cannot quote a fare is not a minicab app. So the fare is
 * computed here, from the distance and duration Google Routes returns, using
 * the tariff below. No backend required.
 *
 * ── Why the numbers are here and not in the database ───────────────────────
 * They should end up in Supabase so the office can change a tariff without a
 * deploy — that work is tracked separately. Putting them in code first is
 * deliberate: it makes the product work today, and it puts every rate in one
 * reviewable place with its reasoning attached, which is a far better starting
 * point for a migration than rates scattered through a backend that nobody can
 * currently run.
 *
 * ── These are placeholder rates and MUST be checked ────────────────────────
 * They are modelled on typical London private-hire pricing, not on AC7's
 * actual tariff, which only you know. Every one of them is wrong until you say
 * otherwise. A quoted price is a promise to a rider, so read this table before
 * taking a single real booking.

 * The tariff table.
 *
 * ── Why per-mile AND per-minute ────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Distance alone underpays a driver stuck on the Euston Road for forty
 * minutes; time alone underpays them on a clear run to Heathrow. Every
 * established operator charges both, and a driver who feels underpaid on
 * traffic-heavy jobs simply stops accepting them.
 *
 * ── Why there is a minimum fare ────────────────────────────────────────────
 * A half-mile job still costs a driver the approach, the wait and the fuel. At
 * pure per-mile rates it would earn under two pounds and no driver would take
 * it, so the rider gets no car at all. The minimum is what makes short local
 * journeys — which are most of a neighbourhood firm's work — worth accepting.
