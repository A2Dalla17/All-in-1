/**
 * AC7 Ride — feature flags (runtime)
 *
 * ── The distinction from env.features ──────────────────────────────────────
 * `env.features` in config/env.ts are BUILD-time constants. They are read from
 * import.meta.env, so the bundler can see them and delete the dead branch
 * entirely. That is the right tool when you want the code to not exist in the
 * shipped bundle at all.
 *
 * The flags in this file are RUNTIME. They are read from the database on every
 * load, so changing one takes effect without a rebuild and without a deploy —
 * which is the entire point of a kill switch. The cost is that both branches
 * are in the bundle.
 *
 * Use a build flag to hide something unfinished from the bundle.
 * Use a runtime flag for anything you might need to switch off in a hurry.
 *
 * ── Why the defaults are duplicated here ───────────────────────────────────
 * The database holds a `fallback` column, but that column is unreachable when
 * the database is the thing that is broken. So the safe answer for each flag
 * is also compiled into the client. If Supabase is down, the app still renders
 * — with every new feature absent, which is the correct failure direction: a
 * missing feature is an inconvenience, a half-initialised one is a bug report.
