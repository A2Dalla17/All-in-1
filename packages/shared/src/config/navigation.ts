 * Runs and Bookings are routes inside this app and must use the router or the

 * than decided by each consumer, because getting it wrong is invisible in
 * development — where everything is on localhost — and obvious in production.

       a full page load to another origin. It is a route in this application
       now, so a <Link> is correct: pressing Taxi transitions straight into
       the product with no reload, no white flash and no second bundle
       download. Leaving it as `href` would still "work", which is exactly
       why it is worth stating: it would silently keep the old two-app feel
       after the two apps had already been merged. */
