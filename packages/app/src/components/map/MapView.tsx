/**
 * ACT — the map
 *
 * Google draws it. Leaflet exists only so the app is never without a map.
 *
 * ── Why there is a fallback at all ─────────────────────────────────────────
 * Google's Dynamic Maps SKU gives 10,000 map loads a month and then charges.
 * The daily quota cap in Cloud Console is what stops that becoming a bill, and
 * when it trips, Google refuses. If Google were the only renderer, the rider
 * would be staring at a grey rectangle at the exact moment they were trying to
 * get home — a cost control taking the product down is a bad trade for a
 * minicab firm.
 *
 * So Leaflet stays, dormant. It renders when, and only when:
 *   - no Google key is configured
 *   - the Maps script fails to load (offline, blocked, wrong referrer)
 *   - the monthly map-load budget is spent
 *
 * The rider is not told which one they are looking at, because it is not their
 * problem and there is nothing they could do about it.
 *
 * ── Why the script is loaded here rather than in index.html ────────────────
 * A <script> tag in the document head downloads the Maps library for everyone,
 * including a visitor who only reads the terms page and never sees a map. The
 * library is large. Loading it from the first component that actually needs a
 * map means the landing site stays light, and it is the only way the "no key
 * configured" path can avoid the request entirely.
