/**
 * Community advertising — the showcase carousel under the hero.
 *
 * ── One slot became several ────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * The homepage used to show a single banner. It now rotates through everything
 * live: featured businesses, restaurant and shop promotions, seasonal
 * campaigns, company announcements, and the Driver of the Quarter. `priority`
 * still decides who leads; `sort_order` decides reading order among equals.
 *
 * ── Why the spotlight window is derived, not scheduled ─────────────────────
 * For the first few days of each calendar quarter the Driver of the Quarter is
 * promoted to the front of the rotation. That window is computed from the date
 * on every page load rather than flipped by a scheduled job, because a cron
 * that fails silently leaves last quarter's winner leading the homepage for
 * three months and nobody notices until a customer mentions it.
