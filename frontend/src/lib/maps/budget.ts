/**
 * ACT — Google Maps Platform call budget
 *
 * Counts what this browser has spent against each Google SKU this month and
 * refuses to spend past a self-imposed ceiling, so the app falls back to the
 * free OpenStreetMap path instead of running up a bill.
 *
 * ── Free tiers do not pool, which is the whole reason this is per SKU ───────
 * Since March 2025 there is no shared monthly credit. Each Essentials SKU
 * carries its own 10,000 free calls: Geocoding has ten thousand, Autocomplete
 * Session Usage has a separate ten thousand, Compute Routes another. A single
 * combined counter would either stop everything the moment one API got busy,
 * or let a quiet API's headroom mask a busy one running into charges. Neither
 * is what the number means, so the counter is keyed by SKU.
 *
 * ── What this is NOT ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * This is not the spending limit. It cannot be: it lives in localStorage on
 * one device, so ten riders each get their own counter and the true total is
 * the sum of all of them. Anyone can clear it, and nothing here is enforced by
 * Google.
 *
 * The enforceable limit is the per-API daily quota cap set in Cloud Console
 * (docs/GOOGLE-MAPS-SETUP.md). That one is server-side, global, and returns a
 * hard error when exceeded. This layer sits above it and serves a different
 * purpose: a quota rejection is an error the rider sees, whereas predicting
 * the rejection lets the app quietly use the free provider instead. One
 * protects the wallet; this protects the experience while saving money on the
 * way.
 *
 * ── Why the month key is UTC ───────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Google bills on UTC months. A counter that rolled over at local midnight
 * would reset a day early for a rider in Auckland and hand out a month's
 * allowance twice.
