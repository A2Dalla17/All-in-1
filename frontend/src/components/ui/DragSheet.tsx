/**
 * ACT — draggable bottom sheet
 *
 * The panel that sits over a map and snaps between two heights, as in every
 * ride-hailing app. Distinct from ui/Sheet, which is a modal that opens over
 * the page and closes; this one is always present and never goes away.
 *
 * ── Why drag is limited to the handle and header ───────────────────────────
 * If the whole sheet were draggable, every attempt to scroll a long list of
 * search results would drag the sheet down instead. Uber and Bolt both take
 * the same approach: a grab area at the top, and normal scrolling everywhere
 * below it.
 *
 * ── Why Pointer Events rather than touch handlers ──────────────────────────
 * One code path covers finger, mouse and stylus. Touch-only handlers mean the
 * sheet cannot be dragged on a laptop, which is exactly where it gets tested.
 * `setPointerCapture` keeps the drag alive when the finger leaves the handle,
 * which otherwise strands the sheet halfway.
 *
 * ── Why it is also a button ────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Dragging is not available to somebody using a keyboard or a screen reader.
 * The handle is a real <button> that toggles between snap points, so the sheet
 * is fully operable without a pointer.
