   *
   * ── Why this is a different key from googleMapsBrowserKey ─────────────────
   * That one is for the Maps JavaScript API and is currently unused: the map
   * itself renders with Leaflet against OpenStreetMap tiles, which cost
   * nothing however many times they load. This key is for the web-service
   * REST endpoints — Autocomplete, Place Details, Geocoding, Routes — which
   * are the calls actually worth paying for.
   *
   * Separating them is what lets each be restricted to only the APIs it
   * needs in Cloud Console. A single key allowed to call everything is one
   * stolen key away from a bill on every product at once.
   *
   * ── Why the map deliberately stays off Google ─────────────────────────────
   * Google's Dynamic Maps SKU bills per map load with 10,000 free per month,
   * roughly 330 a day. The rider home screen IS a map, and one ride touches
   * home, booking and tracking. Putting the map on Google would spend the
   * entire free allowance on tiles, leaving nothing for address search — which
   * is the part Google is genuinely better at, and the part Nominatim is worst
   * at for UK postcodes.
   *
   * The tiles come from a raster provider instead (see MapView). Note the open
   * licensing item recorded in docs/GOOGLE-MAPS-SETUP.md: the current CARTO
   * tiles are not licensed for commercial use and need swapping before launch.
   * That is a tile decision and does not affect anything below.

     * obvious-looking variable does nothing at all: no error, no warning, the
     * app just quietly keeps using the free geocoder. That already happened
     * once, and a silent no-op is the worst possible failure for a config
     * value somebody has just gone to the trouble of obtaining.
     *
     * Using one key for both is acceptable but not ideal: it means the same
     * key must be allowed to call every API in use, so a leak exposes all of

   * with an error, whereas this predicts the rejection and takes the free
   * OpenStreetMap path instead, so the rider sees a working address search
