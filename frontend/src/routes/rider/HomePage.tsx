/**
 * ACT — rider home
 *
 * The map, where you are, and where you are going.
 *
 * ── Map above, sheet below ─────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * The first attempt floated cards over a full-bleed map. On a phone that left
 * the controls stranded in the middle of nowhere; on a desktop the cards
 * stretched the full width of the window. Uber and Bolt both solve it the
 * same way and for the same reason: the map takes the top, a sheet owns the
 * bottom, and the sheet can be dragged up when the rider needs more room —
 * for a list of search results — or pushed down when they want to see where
 * they are.
 *
 * The sheet is capped at max-w-lg so a wide monitor gets a panel rather than
 * a control strip two feet across.
 *
 * ── Why location is asked for with a button, not on load ───────────────────
 * A permission prompt that fires the instant a page opens gets refused, and
 * once refused the browser will not ask again — the rider has to dig through
 * site settings to undo it. Asking after a deliberate tap, with the reason
 * visible above it, is the difference between a yes and a permanent no.

   * The search is debounced, and the debounce lives in an effect. Adding

   * biases results toward where the rider is — but useGeolocation runs
   * `watchPosition`, which fires on every GPS update and builds a NEW
   * `{lat, lng}` object each time.
   *
   * A new object is a new dependency identity, so the effect tore down and
   * rebuilt on every fix, and its cleanup cleared the pending timer. With
   * fixes arriving faster than the 1100 ms debounce, the timeout was reset
   * before it could ever fire: typing produced no request at all, no error,
   * and nothing on screen. Confirmed by watching the network — zero calls to
   * Google or Nominatim while typing.
   *
   * A ref carries the value without participating in the dependency list, so
   * the search still biases to the rider's location and the timer is only
   * reset by what should reset it: the query changing.

   * This is a billed Geocoding call. useGeolocation runs `watchPosition`, so
   * depending on the position object re-ran this on every GPS update — and in
   * a moving car that is roughly one paid call per second. Three hours of
   * driving would have burned the entire monthly free tier, and the only
   * symptom would have been a bill.
   *
   * Rounding to three decimal places is about 110 m, so the effect fires when
   * the rider has actually moved somewhere with a different name, not when
   * the GPS jitters by a few metres while they stand still. The cache in
   * lib/maps/cache.ts rounds harder still (~11 m) and catches the rest.
   *
   * Cosmetic either way — the coordinates work regardless of the label — so a
   * failure here is swallowed rather than surfaced.
